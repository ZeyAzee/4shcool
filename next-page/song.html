    <p class="df">Best Ariana Grande Songs: 5 Essential Tracks</p><br>
    <div class="sec2">
    <div class="dv2">5: ‘The Way’ <br>
When ‘The Way’ was released in January 2013, many critics pegged Grande as the next Mariah Carey. However, over the hip-hop flavoured, piano-sampling of Brenda Russell’s ‘A Little Bit Of Love’, Grande’s voice sounded a bit sweeter and softer than the elder stateswoman of pop balladry. For the then 20-year-old singer, that sound would be the consistent through line for her debut album, Yours Truly. <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_sV0S8qWSy0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><br></div>
    <div class="dv2">4: ‘Side To Side’<br>
‘Side To Side’, which infamously featured Nicki Minaj rapping about phallic bicycles, was overtly sexual, to say the least. The innuendos alluding to the before and after of sexual escapades resonated with fans, as did the mock-SoulCycle music video. As Minaj raps over the tropical-pop track, “Young Ari run pop.” She didn’t realise what a prescient statement it would be. <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SXiSVQZLje8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><br></div>
    <div class="dv2">3: ‘Dangerous Woman’<br>
For her third studio album, Grande would stage one of her greatest reinventions. At this point in her career, some still questioned the maturity of Grande’s music. With its sleek sensuality and vocalese delivery, ‘Dangerous Woman’ not only served as a barbed rejoinder to her critics but introduced a new side to Grande as a confident young woman in charge of her own sexuality. <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9WbCfHutDSE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><br></div>
    <div class="dv2">2: ‘Into You’<br>
‘Into You’ saw Grande lean into a campy dance-pop sound. It’s the most danceable track on Dangerous Woman and grows from a steady pulse to a full-on club banger. Modelled after thrill-seeking 80s pop, Grande throws an electric guitar on top, going full arena rock. The single would also be the first in a long line of LGBTQ anthems that the best Ariana Grande songs would be embraced for. <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1ekZEVeXwek" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><br></div>
    <div class="dv2">1: ‘God is a woman’<br>
Sweetener not only marked a new chapter for Grande the pop star, but saw her grow more confident as an artist, following through on her promise of becoming a “dangerous woman”. A key song in this change was ‘God is a woman’. Upon its summer 2018 release, the trap-flavoured anthem signalled a newly unapologetic and confident mode for the 25-year-old Grande. At the 2018 MTV Video Music Awards she debuted an ambitious choreography that saw her in control, and championing the physique of women. <br>
